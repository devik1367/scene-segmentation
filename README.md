# Eluvio-scene-segmentation

The notebook file contains my submission for the Eluvio DS/ML Challenge 2021.
 
To run:
1. Download/clone repository/notebook. 
2. Upload the notebook to google drive.
3. Put the data directory in the same file as the notebook.
4. Open the notebook in Google Colaboratory and change the data paths in the 4th and 8th cells (if you need to change anything else, I'm sorry in advance!).

I used TPU runtime since that was the only thing that didn't cause my file to crash repeatedly.
